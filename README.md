## Task:

You will use the provided text file for this submission. It contains short strings on separate lines. 
Many of these strings have a number prefix, i.e. “2 Steaks”, “10 Chicken Wings”, “343GuiltySparks”. 
Prepare a program that accepts a file or path and creates or returns a file with the same short strings sorted. 
Sort first by the numeric value of any leading number (2 < 10 < 343) and then alphabetically for the rest of the string.

## To run the script:
No extra libraries were used, just pure Python v3.11. To run the script:

```bash
python main.py ./data/example-list.txt ./data/sample-output.txt
```
